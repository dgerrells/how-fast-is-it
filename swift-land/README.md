# Start

Swift land's version of a simd optimized particle simulation matching similar setups as other languages.

## Build

Open the xcode project and run. Ha, just kidding. This is apple and depending on what OS and xcode version you have you likely need to waffle around with sdk version, installs, etc. 

Once you DO get that done, press the play button in xcode and rejoice at millions of pretty particles.
